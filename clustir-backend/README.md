# Backend Setup (Node.js Express)

Welcome to the backend setup guide for your Node.js Express project! This README will walk you through configuring environment variables and setting up the project.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the backend project directory.

```bash
cd clustir-backend
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
DB_URL ="mongodb+srv://rajesh:vyFD%24!Pz7RTdrcV@cluster0.cfd7p6x.mongodb.net/businessUserModel"
MAIL_HOST="smtp.ethereal.email"
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME="vivian.hahn@ethereal.email"
MAIL_PASSWORD="MrYjFTTMdqbwsuCh2h"
MAIL_FROM="admin@gmail.com"
MAIL_SUBJECT="Your OTP"
JWT_SECRET="key23KFUWqdi789"
```

Make sure to replace the values with the appropriate configuration for your environment. For example, replace `DB_URL` with your MongoDB connection string, and update the email-related variables with your SMTP server details.

## Installation

Next, install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Development Server

To run the backend server in development mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Production Build

For production deployment, you typically don't need to build your backend code as you would with a frontend application. Instead, you can start the server using a process manager like `pm2` or `forever`.

For example, to start the server in production mode using `pm2`, you can use the following command:

```bash
pm2 start index.js --name clustir-backend
```

Replace `index.js` with the entry point of your server file and `your-app-name` with the desired name for your application process.

## Additional Configuration

Depending on your project requirements, you may need to configure additional settings such as CORS, middleware, routes, etc. Make sure to update your Express application accordingly.
